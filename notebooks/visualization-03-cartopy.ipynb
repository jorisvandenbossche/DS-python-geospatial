    "# Maps in Scientific Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Making maps is a fundamental part of GIS and geoscience research.\n",
    "Maps differ from regular figures in the following principle ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Maps require a *projection* of geographic coordinates on the 3D Earth to the 2D space of your figure.\n",
    "- Maps often include extra decorations besides just our data (e.g. continents, country borders, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The maps we have made up to now, for example using the GeoPandas `plot()` method, assume the data can be plotted as is on the figure. This works fine if your data is already in projected coordinates, and has a limited extent (small study area). When mapping data of a larger area of the full globe, properly taking into account the projection becomes much more important!\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will learn about [Cartopy](https://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/docs/latest/), one of the most common packages for making maps within python.\n",
