    "Air pollution remains a key environmental problem in an increasingly urbanized world.

    "The [**CurieuzeNeuzen**](https://curieuzeneuzen.be/curieuzeneuzen-vlaanderen-2018/) citizen science project collected a large, spatially distributed dataset that can complement official monitoring. In a first edition in 2016, in Antwerp, 2000 citizens were involved. This success was followed by a second edition in 2018 engaging 20.000 citizens across Flanders, a highly urbanized, industrialized and densely populated region in Europe. The participants measured the NO2 concentrations in front of their house using a low-cost sampler design (see picture below, where passive sampling tubes are attached using a panel to a window at the facade). \n",
